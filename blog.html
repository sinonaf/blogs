            <h2>Recent Post: Music And Our Brain</h2>
            <p>Anger, tranquility; sadness, elation; through break ups and new love; when we feel down; to concentrate when studying; or for adrenaline before a sports game; music is what we long for to feel comfort in the ups and downs of life. Shifts in brain activity due to music have only have recently been recorded, thus being an intriguing topic of discussion. 

Essentially, music is a combination of notes, rhythms, melodies, and vocals that the brain absorbs and processes as a song. Sound waves in the air create vibrations in the eardrum that then become electrical signals. The auditory nerve, spanning from the inner ear to the brain stem, encodes the details of the sound and sends it to the temporal lobe to process. The right hemisphere of the temporal lobe interprets the instrumentals and music, while the left hemisphere decodes the language and lyrics. 

Surprisingly, the way the brain processes music is not same for every one: brain scans have showed that professional musicians “hear” music differently than others do. Rather than engage the temporal lobe, listening to music causes professional musicians to employ the visual or occipital lobe, indicating that they may be visualizing sheet music or notes while listening. The hypothalamus and autonomic nervous system (ANS) are affected by music, leading to changes in heart rate, sleep, mood, breathing, and other unconscious behaviors. 

The limbic system, which monitors reward and motivation, becomes active, and dopamine and serotonin are released, boosting happiness and enhancing focus. The amygdala, which governs emotions, works in conjunction with the hippocampus to recall emotional memories tied to the music. Listening to music also affects the motor system, which makes dancing or tapping your foot to the beat come naturally. 

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), located in the frontal lobe and implicated in decision-making, displays hyperactivity when listening to music, similar to the hyperactivity the OFC typically displays in people with OCD. An explanation for this is that the tension, anticipation, and resolution of music require high focus and concentration.

 Furthermore, interpreting lyrics and producing speech engages Broca’s Area and Wernicke’s Area, and, as a result, music may improve language processing. Due to its strong nature, patients with neurodegenerative diseases may even remember how to play instruments like the piano. Attaching rhythms and melody to phrases can help the brain recall them more easily—a technique heavily used in commercials. Some studies have found that listening to Mozart while working can enhance spatial processing.

 Music can also boost memory by triggering neurogenesis, or the formation of neurons, in the hippocampus. Music has the power to evoke specific emotions and can be used in therapy, specifically in regard to memory and neurodegenerative diseases. By affecting the putamen, rhythms in music can temporarily reduce symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and help patients with coordination and walking. Furthermore, research has suggested that people with epilepsy can minimize the occurrence of seizures by listening to Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major. 


Overall, more research is needed to fully understand how music affects the brain and to explore possible medical implications.</p>
